# STA9760_Project2_Yelp_Data_Analysis---Analyzing 10Gb of Yelp Reviews Data.
We will analyze a subset of Yelp's business, reviews and user data. This dataset comes to us from ##Kaggle## although we have taken steps to pull this data into a publis s3 bucket, and run the analysis via Jupyter Notebook and the expected output artifact is a .ipynb file deployed to Github.
